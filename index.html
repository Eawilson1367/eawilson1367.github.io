    <h1>My Name is Edward Arrington Wilson</h1>
    <p>I am becoming a certified yoga instructor after 200 hours of training.  With my free time, I enjoy listen music, building legos and learning about spanish culture.  One day, when I become a home owner, I'll have a room dedicated to building legos and I want to spend six months in a spanish speaking country.  </p>
