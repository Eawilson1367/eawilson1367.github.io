This Github account was created for Web,Pgm & Db Founddation Course with Kristopher Roark
This is my first attempt using Github and creating a repository
Clonig my repository  was successful after a first failed attempted, I made an error naming the respository name, adding a "." at the end creating an error that wouldn't allow it to be downloaded to my local machine.  After that was fixed, I had to change the path to the CTS 110 Assignment folder that was created from a prior assignment because it defaulted to my school email's OneDrive account.  After that, I was allowed to make neccessary changes
